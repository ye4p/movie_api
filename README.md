# Limited Movie search app API
# This projects was created with a purpose to evaluate my current HTML/CSS skills by building these parts from nothing as my first independent project and then practicing JavaScript fetch() API requests
# It uses free API https://www.tvmaze.com/api to make requests to it and get JSON file to then show images of found movies/series and show them on a screen
